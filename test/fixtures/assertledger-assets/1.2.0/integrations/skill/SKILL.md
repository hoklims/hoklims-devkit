# AssertLedger skill

Use this skill when an agent is asked to generate tests whose actual evidence must be checked.

AssertLedger was formerly named TestForge. The `assertledger` CLI is the preferred binary; the
`testforge` binary remains a legacy-compatible alias for the same commands during the compatibility
window.

## Preferred path: a committed regression

1. Run `assertledger doctor <repo> --json` for static readiness. Runtime probes require the separate
   `doctor --runtime --allow-unsafe-execution` command and prior operator authorization. A
   `UNSUPPORTED_REPOSITORY_SYMLINK` conflict stays a refusal: only the operator may declare the
   local-only entry that holds the link with `--exclude NAME`. Never add names to
   `repository.exclude` yourself; the configured list never removes files from campaign evidence.
2. Ask the operator or harness for the buggy, corrected and neutral revisions, the neutral reason,
   candidate path and unchanged base tests. Do not invent a neutral control's meaning.
3. For committed dependency-free JavaScript `node:test`, use `assertledger check` or the MCP
   `assertledger_check` tool. The server operator must enable execution; a tool payload cannot grant it.
4. Preserve the manifest and run `assertledger replay`. Use `assertledger explain CODE` or the
   read-only `assertledger_explain` tool to understand a refusal without changing the policy.
5. The configuration, skill and server do not grant trust. Never treat a crash, timeout, compilation
   error or missing test as detection. The returned limitations remain part of the result.

## Lower-level verification requests

1. Run `assertledger init <repo> --dry-run --json`, review conflicts and planned bytes, then run
   `assertledger init <repo> --json`. Initialization is static and manages only the two AssertLedger
   root files; it never executes a command or generates worlds or candidates.
2. Run `assertledger audit <repo> --json`, then `assertledger analyze <repo> --json` for generation
   context. Audit may report `VERIFICATION_REQUEST_UNAVAILABLE` until the harness supplies the two
   required operator inputs: `worlds` and `candidates`.
3. Propose candidate files only under the config's `candidateRoots`.
4. Do not let candidate content choose worlds, expected outcomes, policy, or budgets. Those belong to
   the operator or harness.
5. Submit all candidates in one versioned verification request.
6. Run `assertledger verify <request> --allow-unsafe-execution --json` only when the controlling human
   or CI policy has authorized the `UNSANDBOXED` local backend.
7. Preserve the returned manifest, then run `assertledger replay <manifest> --json`.
8. Treat only `VERIFIED` plus a replay result whose `valid` field is true as positive evidence. This
   requires valid schema, decision digest, artifact digest, and decision semantics. `REJECTED`,
   `INCONCLUSIVE`, invalid input, engine errors, and invalid replay results are stop conditions, not
   soft passes.
9. Preserve the emitted manifest as the auditable artifact. Never summarize away failed attempts,
   controls, limitations, or isolation level.

Never claim that AssertLedger proves overall program correctness or universal non-flakiness.
